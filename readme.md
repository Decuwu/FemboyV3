- It's as simple as that and you can then, in your 2take1 menu, go to `local > scripts` and you will see FemboyV3 there available to load
  - before loading you must enable the following:
    - Natives
    - HTTP

# scid.cfg
scid.cfg contains a list of GTA Online admins, this is required for the "Redirect SCID Joins To Admins" to work as it requires them to be fake friends in your 2take1 menu.

To install this, download it and head to `%appdata%\popstardevs\2take1menu\cfg` and drag the file into there. If you dont want to replace your current fake friends list, you can just copy and paste the file contents into the current scid.cfg in that folder
